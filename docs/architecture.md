# Architecture

## YieldSense AI — Platform Architecture Overview

The platform is structured in layers, from user-facing clients down to infrastructure:

### 1. Users
Farmers, Agriculture Departments, Agri Consultants, Researchers, Administrators.

### 2. Web / Mobile Application Layer
- Home Dashboard
- Farm Management
- Yield Analysis
- Weather Analysis
- Soil Analysis
- Reports & Notifications
- Support

### 3. External Data & Services
- Weather APIs
- Soil Data Sources
- Agriculture Datasets
- Government Open Data

### 4. API Gateway
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT / OAuth 2.0)
- Request Routing
- Rate Limiting
- Logging & Monitoring

### 5. AI & Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Collection** — crop information, historical yield data, farm management data, soil test results, irrigation data
2. **Data Preprocessing** — data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, data normalization
3. **Weather Analysis** — rainfall analysis, temperature trends, humidity & wind analysis, seasonal pattern detection, weather impact scoring
4. **Soil Analysis** — soil nutrient analysis, pH & moisture analysis, fertility assessment, soil health index, suitability scoring
5. **Yield Prediction Model** — machine learning model (XGBoost / Random Forest / LightGBM), training & evaluation, confidence estimation
6. **Prediction Outputs** — predicted yield (kg/ha), productivity score, risk assessment, season comparison, trend forecast
7. **Recommendations** — crop suggestions, fertilizer advice, irrigation plan, pest management tips, best practices

### 6. Agricultural Analytics & Insights
- Yield trend analysis
- Farm performance comparison
- Seasonal insights
- Weather impact analysis
- Risk & anomaly detection
- Reports & expert insights
- Prediction accuracy tracking
- Dashboard insights

### 7. Data & Storage Layer
- User database (PostgreSQL)
- Operational database (MongoDB)
- Historical crop data storage
- Weather data storage (AWS S3 / Blob)
- Soil data storage & archive
- Data warehouse (analytics data)
- Backup & recovery (scheduled)

### 8. Infrastructure Layer
- Cloud platform (AWS / Azure)
- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)
- Load balancer (high availability)
- WAF / firewall & security
- Monitoring (Prometheus / Grafana)
- CI/CD pipeline (deployment)
- Backup & disaster recovery

### 9. Integrations
- Mobile app
- AI model server (TensorFlow Serving)
- GIS / mapping services
- Email / SMS services
- Push notification services

## Legend / Flow Types
- User / Request flow
- Service communication
- Data flow
- External integration
- AI / model flow
- Notification flow
